Ornament and Crime for Loudest Warning Format

please note that there are two different spacings in use. 

The "broken grid" variant pushes two rows a bit closer together towards the screen at the bottom. This preserves the spacing of the top row at the cost of a crowded set of jacks nearer the encoders and  screen. 

IN ALMOST ALL CASES (unless you've made your own panels) you will want to use the main files found in the main repository.
